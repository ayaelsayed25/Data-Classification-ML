# Data-Classification-ML
 In this project, Different classification models such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forests, AdaBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) are applied to MAGIC gamma telescope dataset. Hyper parameter tuning is applied to these models and different models are compared according to the performance.
